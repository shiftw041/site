Welcome to my personal website. This site is built on the jekyll-TeXt-theme template.

The initial intention was to provide an intuitive and rapid way for others to understand my personal information and academic background. During the preparation for the recommendation for postgraduate studies, I realized the need for a public channel to share and exchange my learning notes, rather than just local archiving. Although I had been in contact with GitHub for a long time, I had not made full use of it; this change is hoped to serve as a reference for those who come after.

This site will display my resume, research achievements, and project experience, documenting my journey towards graduate studies. I hope it can not only help me organize and present but also inspire others.

欢迎来到我的个人网站。本站点是基于jekyll-TeXt-theme模板构建的。

建立的初衷是想要让他人直观、快速地了解我的基本情况。在准备保研的过程中，我意识到需要一个公开分享和交流的渠道来记录和展示我的学习笔记，而不仅仅是本地存档。虽然早已接触GitHub，却未能充分利用，这次改变但愿能为后来者提供借鉴。

本站将展示我的简历、研究成果和项目经验，记录保研之路。希望它不仅能帮助我梳理和展示，也能给予他人灵感。
