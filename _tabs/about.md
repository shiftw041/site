I am a junior in school of Cyber Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. (CV: [EN](https://shiftw041.github.io/online-resume/) | [CN](https://shiftw041.github.io/online-resume/cn)

I am enthusiastic about the prospect of furthering my studies in China, particularly in the field of efficient artificial intelligence. Throughout my undergraduate program, I have not only achieved excellent academic results, ranking 6th out of 98 with an average GPA of 4.43/5, but also actively involved in various research projects.

While I have a clear interest and some research foundation in the field of efficient AI, I am equally open and curious about unfamiliar research areas. I believe that through further study and continuous learning, I can make continuous progress on the path of scientific research and explore more possibilities.

I am looking forward to joining a research group that aligns with me and embarking on my graduate studies, climbing the academic summit together with like-minded peers.

# Experience

## Innovative Training Project â€” Predicting Chip Test Termination Based on Diffusion Model (2023.03 - 2023.11)
- Investigated the application of diffusion model algorithms in the EDA chip domain, improving fault diagnosis efficiency and quality by transforming test feedback into images. 
- Designed machine learning algorithms combined with dynamic test termination prediction, using the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model to expand the image dataset for training.
- Achieved higher accuracy and nearly 90% cost savings in test cost with the new scheme compared to the original one.
- Team contributed the paper "Translating Test Responses to Images for Test-termination Prediction via Multiple Machine Learning Strategies," submitted to ACM-TODEAS (CCF-B).
